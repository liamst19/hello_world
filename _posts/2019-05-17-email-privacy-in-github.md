It appears that, if you don't configure your account email settings correctly in GitHub, it's possible that your email address is exposed in your commit history:

GitHub does provide an option to mask your commit email address, replacing it with a redirect e-mail which looks like: `<a generated number>+<your username>@users.noreply.github.com`. It's under `Personal Settings` â†’ `Emails`.

There is also a way to go through and edit your commit histories. The following has the instructions with a bash script you can run:

 - [Changing author info -  GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/en/articles/changing-author-info).
 
 This seems tough to do if you have many repositories, but I suppose that someone who has that many would be likely to know how to automate on his or her own.
